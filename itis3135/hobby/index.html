            <h2>What is FIRST Robotics?</h2>
            <p>FIRST Robotics, also known as For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, 
                is a robotics competition that allows students to show their creative minds in creating robots to achieve different goals and objectives. 
                It's a global competition to help inspire students to spark creativity and innovation. Different schools can participate and compete against each other, 
                gaining valuable experience in business, technology, and teamwork.</p>

            <p>FIRST has multiple different competitions for high school and middle school students, FIRST Tech Challenge, FIRST Robotics, and FIRST Lego League. 
                Each competition has their own goals, challenges and objectives.</p>

            <h2>About My Team!</h2>
            <p>My robotics team is Avian Robotics 9005. It was founded in 2022 at East Mecklenburg High School. 
                We were a team of around 10-15 people with a mix of juniors and seniors, and only 3 girls. 
                We focused on challenging ourselves to new things and learning. 
                As a rookie team we were new to everything and got mentoring and help from our mentor team Yeti Robotics.</p>

            <h2>When did I do Robotics?</h2>
            <p>I did robotics during my senior year in high school. I wish that I had the opportunity to do it earlier, 
                but it wasn't founded and created until my senior year. 
                I still try to mentor and help the team out whenever I get the chance to in my free time. 
                Even though I can't compete anymore, I try my best to give any advise or help.</p>
            <h2>Best Memories</h2>
            <p>Some of the best memories I had were the late nights we all stayed up to get the robot working and running. 
                We all were able to create a connection and bond by working on this robot, it felt like I found a new family.
                Even though we went through some rough times with creating the robot and communication, we still got through it.</p>

                <tr>
                    <th>Event Name</th>

            </table>
            <p>We were able to make it in the top 20 to reach the state championship. 
                At UNC Asheville, we won the Rookie Inspiration Award.
                At Mecklenburg County, we won Rookie All Star Award.
                It was very stressfull at first because we didn't get the Rookie All Star Award at first so we needed to get top 20. 
                But since we won the Rookie All Star Award, we were guarenteed into States.

        <section id="how">
            <h2>How did we do it?</h2>
            <p>First we started with recruiting new team members so that we could get a bigger team with more hands to work on things. 
                After doing some recruiting, we needed to do outreach to get sponsers to help us pay for the materials to build the robot. 
                Then we needed to strategically plan out how we were going to spend the money, things that we needed, and things that we didn't need. 
                After getting the materials, we then divided the group into the different things that people wanted to persue, whether it be electrial, programming, or mechanical.
            </p>

                <figcaption class="caption"><i>Photo of the Team Booth</i></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Every team was willing to lend a hand to each other. 
                Even though it is a competition and we are competing against each other, we all should still help each other in the time of need. 
                When one team is struggling we all came together to gather supplies that they needed.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="why">
            <h2>Why did I do it?</h2>
            <p>At first I wasn't very committed to doing it since the team wasn't really formed yet. 
                But then I decided to try and go to the club more often and become a reliable member. 
                It felt like a good opportunity to get out of the house more, while also gaining hands on experiences in engineering.
                I thought that it would be interesting to give it a try with some of my other friends.</p>

            <figure>

                <figcaption class="caption"><i>Photo of half the Team!</i></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>I would 100% recommend this to other people if they have the chance to do it. 
                I think that it's an important program that all schools should have access to, because it can help give students useful skills and experiences.
                It's a good experience to learn new things, network, and explore career options.
